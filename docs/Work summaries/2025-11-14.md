 Session Summary: Runway Direction Detection System

  1. README Documentation Update ✅

  File Modified: README.md

  What was added:
  - Dashboards Section (~110 lines of documentation)
    - Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard (/dashboard)
        - System overview stats (total airports, active status, parsing success rates)
      - Activity tracking (updates over last hour/day/week/month)
      - Runway configuration changes feed (last 24 hours)
      - Low confidence alerts (airports < 100%)
      - Stale airport detection (no updates in 3+ hours)
      - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
    - Human Review Dashboard (/review)
        - Queue prioritization system (low confidence, empty arrays, failures)
      - Review workflow documentation (display → correct → submit/skip)
      - Learning system explanation (how corrections are stored and used)
      - Example review process with KDEN airport
      - Visual feedback loop diagram showing improvement cycle
      - Statistics tracking (pending reviews, completions, issue types)
  - Updated Training & Improvement Section
    - Added human-in-the-loop as active improvement method
    - SQL queries to monitor accuracy, corrections, and learned patterns
    - Success rate tracking for learned patterns
  - Updated Future Enhancements
    - Marked completed features: monitoring dashboard, review system, learning from corrections
    - Left planned features for future work
  - Updated Contributing & Support
    - Emphasized review dashboard as primary accuracy improvement tool
    - Added all dashboard URLs for easy access

  2. Dashboard UI Updates ✅

  File Modified: runway_api.py (lines 859, 1034-1036)

  Changes Made:
  - Changed page title from "Runway Detection Dashboard" → "Runway Direction Dashboard"
  - Changed h1 heading from "🛬 Runway Detection Dashboard" → "🛬 Runway Direction Dashboard"
  - Added prominent disclaimer below subtitle:
    - Text: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: This system is under development. Accuracy is neither expected nor guaranteed."
    - Styling: Red color (#e74c3c), bold font, with warning emoji
    - Position: Below "Real-time monitoring of airport runway configurations"

  Location: Main dashboard at http://localhost:8000/dashboard

  3. Docker Container Rebuild ✅

  Action Taken:
  docker-compose up -d --build api

  Why needed: The API container doesn't use volume mounts for source files, so changes required a rebuild to take effect

  Result: Container successfully rebuilt and restarted with new changes

  Current System Status

  Services Running:

  - ✅ runway_db (PostgreSQL) - Up 18+ hours, healthy
  - ✅ runway_collector - Up 2+ hours, collecting every 5 minutes via cron
  - ✅ runway_api - Just rebuilt, running with updated dashboard

  Data Collection Status:

  Based on background monitoring, the system is actively:
  - Collecting ATIS data every 5 minutes
  - Parsing runway configurations with confidence scores
  - Tracking runway configuration changes
  - Building review queue for human corrections (254 items pending)

  Available Endpoints:

  - http://localhost:8000/dashboard - Real-time monitoring dashboard
  - http://localhost:8000/review - Human review interface
  - http://localhost:8000/api/runway/{airport} - Current runway config
  - http://localhost:8000/api/status - System health
  - http://localhost:8000/docs - API documentation

  Files Modified This Session

  1. README.md
    - Added comprehensive dashboard documentation
    - Documented human review workflow and learning system
    - Updated training roadmap and contributing guide
  2. runway_api.py
    - Line 859: Updated <title> tag
    - Lines 1034-1036: Updated h1 and added disclaimer

  What's Working

  ✅ Automated ATIS collection every 5 minutes✅ Runway parsing with confidence scoring✅ Real-time monitoring dashboard with auto-refresh✅ Human review system with 254 items in queue✅ Learning feedback loop (corrections stored in database)✅ Change detection and
  tracking✅ Comprehensive documentation

  ---
  Next Steps (When You Resume)

  Potential future work based on the README's roadmap:
  - Apply learned patterns automatically in parser
  - Train machine learning model on human corrections
  - Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Add historical trend analysis
  - Create wind-based runway prediction
  - Consider GraphQL API option

  Immediate action item: Start using the review dashboard at http://localhost:8000/review to review the 254 pending items and improve parsing accuracy through the human-in-the-loop system!

  Great work on building this system! The runway direction detection is now fully operational with monitoring, human review capabilities, and a learning feedback loop. 🛬
